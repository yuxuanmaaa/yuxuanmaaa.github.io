    "text": "3.2 Node2Vec:\n\nIntroduction -\nNode2vec is an algorithmic framework for representational learning on graphs. Given any graph, it can learn continuous feature representations for the nodes, which can then be used for various downstream machine learning tasks.\nCompared to the simple graph we have for Word2Vec, Node2vec can be applied to complexly structured graphs that are “ (un)directed, (un)weighted, or (a)cyclic.” To accomplish that, Node2vec generates biased random walks from each node of the graph. This provides a way of balancing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by smoothly interpolating between BFS and DFS.\n\n\nImplementation -\nUsing random walks through the corpus, we created multiple documents as an input into the Gensim model for vectorizing embeddings using sentences. These embeddings were then analyzed using their corresponding graph clusters.\nThe purpose of random walks is to add context to the Application → API nodes, by looking at corresponding applications or APIs that are neighbors to the starting applications.\nIn the figure under node2vec above we clearly see the distinction between the two classes. On visualizing this on a 2-Dimensional plane it is now possible to use lighter classification models to help classify benign vs malware applications.\n\n\nAnalysis -\nSimilar to node2vec, a distinct number of hyperparameters and model choices influenced the project.\nThe following are a few hyperparameters that had a large impact on the performance of the model -\nWalk length: The count of nodes in each random walk P: Return hyperparameter - controlling the probability of going back to a previous node Q: Input hyperparameter - controlling the probability to traverse to undiscovered parts of the graph For node2vec, these parameters above greatly influence the sampling strategy and how specific they’re intended to be.\nSince the risk factor for misclassifying a malware app as benign is considerably high, we started testing the model and embeddings with a lower probability of backtracking or exploring different parts of the graph. Thus the window size of 2 and 1 respectively.\nOn running the model and creating sentences the graph below shows the distribution of each app from a 2D representation of the graph embeddings. A point represents an app in the graph.\n\nThen we use k-means clustering method to classify the apps from malware to benign apps. The graph below shows the result when k = 2, k=3, and k=4.(see pics below)\n\n\n\nk = 2\n\n\n\n\nHere is the accurate plot differentiating malware from benign apps:\n\nComparing the plots, we can see that k-means clustering provides insight into the natural clusters of the graph. As all the k-means clustering separates clusters horizontally, we can assume that more than 50% of APPs are misclassified. Misclassifying malware as a benign app could cause a huge loss, so K-means clustering isn’t a good algorithm for detecting malware. Looking at the second graph, we see a distinct boundary between the application types. Further analysis would look at different meta paths that could better identify this boundary in addition to classifiers to elevate the creation of decision boundaries.\nOn evaluating multiple classification models for Node2vec we found that Support Vector Machines provided us with the optimal Accuracy and recall tradeoff. We used Support Vector machines with the radial bias function(RBF) kernel, along with a higher than default regularization constant of 5.

The APK’s that contain the smali code are directly downloaded from ‘https://apkpure.com/’ and compiled into .smali files using the apktools library. Thus, this data is then unpackaged using the apktools library that allows us to view the subsequent smali code (a code that humans can interpret) and app binaries. The smali code and app binaries contain a lot of the information derived from the Java source code that allows us to map the number of API calls and the relationships between them."

To better understand the relationships between API calls, and their subsequent properties we explore them through Graph Networks, their ability to learn and traverse, and the corresponding vectorized embeddings.\n\n3.1 Word2vec:\nWord2Vec is one of the most popular techniques to learn word embeddings using a shallow neural network, developed by Tomas Mikolov in 2013 at Google. Word2vec learns the association among words from a large corpus of text, and it could be used to find synonymous words or suggest an additional word for an incomplete sentence using Skip Gram or Common Bag Of Words (CBOW).\nGo to Word2Vec\n\n\n3.2 Node2Vec:\nNode2vec is an algorithmic framework for representational learning on graphs. Given any graph, it can learn continuous feature representations for the nodes, which can then be used for various downstream machine learning tasks.\nCompared to the simple graph we have for Word2Vec, Node2vec can be applied to complexly structured graphs that are “ (un)directed, (un)weighted, or (a)cyclic.” To accomplish that, Node2vec generates biased random walks from each node of the graph.

Heterogeneous graph networks allow us to distinguish different types of nodes and edges(relationship). In our case, using heterogeneous graph networks enable us to see the difference between API and APP nodes.\nOn the other hand, similar to Node2Vec, Metapath2Vec takes random walks to “construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node” and then uses “a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings.”\nGo to Metapath2Vec"

Ideally compared to a lot of academic research and papers, we would want to scale our dataset by a factor of 30 times. Future Research Primarily, in our project - we have 3 graph embedding techniques that are analyzed through their embeddings and models. These models could be expanded to be neural networks or architectures that better help predict embeddings than the current classification models.\nThere are multiple graph embedding models and techniques that go far beyond the ones explored today. Additionally, the scalability and ability to hyper optimize these embeddings their corresponding models exist to a large degree.\nAdditionally, the research of adversarial models through the lens of Graph Embeddings allows a whole new aspect of risk and exploration."

Conclusion\nOverall, with a balance between feasibility of scaling and implementation, we found Node2vec most versatile, allowing us to retain accurate results while forming sentences and correlations that more closely represented the class division of applications. It is often easy to forget while analyzing and writing code, that at the end of it all it’s still a language. Using technology and models designed for linguistic semantics and structure and using it on the binaries of a programming language and application is a meta-analysis that adequately serves its purpose."
